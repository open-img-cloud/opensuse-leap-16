# The upstream openSUSE Leap 16 cloud image already ships cloud-init,
# openssh-server, qemu-guest-agent, a serial console and the
# `opensuse` default user. The org-wide cloud-init policy drop-in
# (datasource_list, disable_root, ssh_pwauth=false, mount_default_fields)
# is injected by the reusable workflow after this script runs.
# Customisation reduces to a package cache cleanup.
